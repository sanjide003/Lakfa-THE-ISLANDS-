# Lakfa ERP — Food Business Operations Ledger

Lakfa ERP is a simple, clean, and highly professional web-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application designed specifically for **Lakfa Foods** to streamline operations, track logistics, manage double-entry accounting cash books, and provide transparent view-only reports to venture capital investors.

This application is built as a static client-side Progressive Web App (PWA) that requires **no compilation, bundlers, or build environments**, making it 100% compatible for instant deployment on platforms like Vercel.

## 🔐 Access Roles
The system is protected by a strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** guard:

1.  **Admin / Manager (`role: "admin"`):** Full access to log raw material purchases, supervise production batches, dispatch orders, log operational expenses, balance ledger sheets, and allocate profit payouts to investors.
2.  **Investor (`role: "investor"`):** Secure, read-only view of their personal capital accounts, profit share allocations, company press releases, and general financial metrics.

## ⚠️ Production Readiness

The web app is now wired to the Firebase project `fest-21d67`. Before entering real customer, accounting, investor, or company data, make sure the Firebase Console has:

1. Email/password authentication enabled.
2. Admin and investor accounts created.
3. Matching `users/{uid}` Firestore role documents created.
4. The rules in `docs/firestore.rules` published to Firestore.

### Firestore Security Rules
The production rules are stored in `docs/firestore.rules`. Apply the same rules in your Firebase Console under the **Firestore Rules** tab:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    function isSignedIn() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }

    function currentUserDoc() {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid));
    }

    function hasActiveRole(role) {
      return isSignedIn()
        && currentUserDoc().data.status == 'active'
        && currentUserDoc().data.role == role;
    }

    function isAdmin() {
      return hasActiveRole('admin');
    }

    function isInvestor() {
      return hasActiveRole('investor');
    }

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if isSignedIn() && (request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin());
      allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if isAdmin() || isInvestor();
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚡ Firebase-only Data Mode
Lakfa ERP no longer ships demo credentials, sample records, or browser-local business storage. Dashboards, ledgers, company profile, logo, and signature branding render records/files from Firebase only. If a Firestore collection is empty, the related module shows an empty state until an admin creates records in Firebase.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Vercel Hosting
Deploying this project to Vercel takes less than a minute and requires no command line tools:
1.  Push the project repository to your **GitHub** account.
2.  Log in to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com).
3.  Click **"Add New"** → **"Project"**.
4.  Import your repository.
5.  Keep the Root Directory as the repository root so Vercel serves the top-level `index.html` login page.
6.  Click **"Deploy"**. Vercel will serve the root `index.html` login page and load the app assets from `lakfa-erp/`.

### 2. Installing PWA
1.  Open the deployed URL in Google Chrome, Edge, or Apple Safari.
2.  Click the **"Install App"** icon in the address bar (or select "Add to Home Screen" on iOS Safari).
3.  Lakfa ERP will run inside a standalone window with its own application frame, accessible offline.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Phase 2 Development)
*   **Firestore Write Workflows:** Products, customers, suppliers, and investors now support admin create/update/delete with audit fields. Remaining operational modules stay read-only until their write workflows are implemented.
*   **Invoicing & GST Forms:** Automatically generate professional PDFs and compile GSTR-1 summaries.
*   **WhatsApp CRM:** Trigger automated dispatch alerts, delivery trackers, and confirmation messages directly to customer phone numbers.
